Electronic Coursework Submission (ECS) system

This project is to design an Electronic Coursework Submission System for a college in which the users will consist of the Assessment Office, Staff, Module Leaders, and Students. 

The requirements consist of related goals, such as producing data entry forms, document generation, live updates, and report generation. These have been broken down into user stories, prioritised, and then allocated to an indiviudal each within the group. Once the functionality has been completed and tested, it will be integrated with the other segments of functionality to construct the solution. 

We will carry out this project using the Scrum methodology, Github, and _____. Blah blah blah blah
